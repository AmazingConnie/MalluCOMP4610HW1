     <h2>Eagle Beach</h2>
     <p>Eagle Beach is by far the most popular and widest beach on the island of Aruba. With its white sands
      and turquoise waters, you will feel like you are in paradise. The many beach huts 
      and bungalows along the coast will give you a sense of mindfulness as you take in the beauty of Aruba's
      waters, home to many of the island's sailboats. In addition to the beach huts and white sands, Eagle Beach is home to two stunning Fofoti trees.
      Despite the humid temperatures, these trees have managed to survive in the middle of the beach and they
      are some of the most photographed trees in Aruba, appearing on promotional materials for the island.</p>

     <h2>Fort Zoutman Historical Museum</h2>
     <p>The oldest remaining building on the island of Aruba, Fort Zoutman was built by the Dutch in 1796 to 
     protect the island from pirates and invaders. The neighboring Willem III Tower was built in 1868 to serve
     as a lighthouse and a clock tower. Today the building serves as a refuge for Aruba's past and present. The museum contains artifacts from 
     the indigenous people of Aruba and documents from Aruba's colonial days under Dutch rule. Additionally, the museum contains a replica
     kitchen to show how Arubans cooked their food in colonial times. </p>
